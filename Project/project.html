                is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland, 
                it is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea in the south. 
                The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands—Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu—and thousands of smaller islands, 
                covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi). Japan has a population of over 123 million as of 2025, 
                making it the eleventh-most populous country.

                        The vast majority of Japan's citizens (99 percent) speak Japanese as their primary language.
                        Japanese is in the Japonic language family and is generally thought to be unrelated to Chinese and Korean. 
                        However, Japanese has borrowed heavily from Chinese, English, and other languages. 
                        In fact, 49 percent of Japanese words are loanwords from Chinese, and 9 percent come from English.
