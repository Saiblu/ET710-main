    <p>The common name "toucan" comes from the sound the birds make, says the San Diego Zoo
        <br>
        Toucans are among the worldâ€™s noisiest birds. When they sing, they sound like frogs croaking. (Listen to a toucan's call via the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Macaulay Library.) They also make tapping and clattering noises with their bills. Some toucan species make barking, growling, and braying sounds.
        <br>
        Female toucans typically have higher voices than males. They use their calls to rally other birds to good foraging sites and to differentiate themselves from other groups of toucans.
